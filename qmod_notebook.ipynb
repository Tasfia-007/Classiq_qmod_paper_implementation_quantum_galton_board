        "A quantum circuit simulates a Galton Board demonstrating exponential speedup by computing \\(2^n\\) trajectories with \\(\\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\) complexity. It uses Hadamard, X, controlled-SWAP, CNOT gates, and mid-circuit resets, modeling ball-peg interactions with modular \"quantum peg\" units.\n",
