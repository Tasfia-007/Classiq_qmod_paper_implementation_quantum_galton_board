        "# **Abstract**\n",
        "Random walks serve as a fundamental model across physics, computer science, and probability theory for understanding diffusion and stochastic motion. While the **classical random walk** exhibits diffusive behavior governed by the central limit theorem, leading to a Gaussian distribution, its **quantum counterpart**—the *quantum random walk (QRW)*—introduces interference and superposition, resulting in non-Gaussian spreading patterns. This unique property enables faster propagation and forms the foundation for several quantum algorithms with proven computational advantages. Inspired by the classical *Galton Board*—a visual model of random motion—the **Quantum Galton Board (QGB)** extends the concept to the quantum domain, where a quantum walker’s evolution is dictated by quantum coin operators such as Hadamard, Gaussian, or exponential. Simulating the QGB through quantum circuits on platforms like *Qiskit* allows direct observation of quantum interference and provides an accessible means to study the transition between classical and quantum transport dynamics.\n",

        "# **Introduction**\n",
        "The random walk has long been recognized as a powerful mathematical tool to describe stochastic motion in natural and computational systems. In the **classical random walk**, a walker moves step-by-step based on probabilistic choices, resulting in diffusive motion that converges to a Gaussian distribution over time. This framework underpins numerous physical phenomena, including Brownian motion, diffusion of heat, and molecular transport.  \n",
        "\n",
        "However, the emergence of **quantum mechanics** introduces new principles—*superposition* and *interference*—that fundamentally alter the nature of random evolution. In a **quantum random walk**, the walker’s state is represented by a complex probability amplitude rather than a simple probability, allowing different paths to interfere constructively or destructively. As a result, the quantum walker spreads quadratically faster than its classical analogue, a feature that has made quantum walks a cornerstone for designing efficient **quantum algorithms** in search, optimization, and transport simulations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To bridge the intuitive understanding of classical diffusion and quantum interference, the **Quantum Galton Board (QGB)** serves as a compelling visual and computational model. Analogous to the classical Galton Board, where balls cascade through pins to form a Gaussian distribution, the QGB replaces random deflections with quantum operations, revealing interference-driven probability distributions.\n",

        "# **Background**\n",
        "The **Galton Board**, or *Quincunx*, provides a classical mechanical representation of the random walk process. In this device, a ball dropped from the top encounters successive rows of pins, randomly deflecting left or right at each level, leading to a binomial distribution that approximates a Gaussian curve at the base. This illustrates the **central limit theorem** in a tangible form.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Extending this system into the **quantum regime** gives rise to the **Quantum Galton Board**, where the motion of the particle is no longer determined by random classical choices but by a **quantum coin operator** that acts on qubits. Depending on the chosen coin—such as the **Hadamard**, **Gaussian**, or **exponential** operator—the quantum walker evolves through superposition across multiple paths simultaneously. Interference between these paths generates unique non-classical probability distributions that deviate significantly from the classical Gaussian pattern.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Using frameworks such as **Qiskit**, these dynamics can be implemented in **quantum circuits**, where each level of the board corresponds to a quantum operation acting on a set of qubits. By comparing the results under both **ideal (noise-free)** and **noisy** quantum backends, researchers can analyze the effects of quantum coherence, decoherence, and interference on transport properties. Consequently, the **Quantum Galton Board** offers a powerful and accessible platform for exploring the boundary between **classical stochastic diffusion** and **quantum coherent evolution**.\n"
